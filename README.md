#About Me
Hi, I'm Joe and I've just recently started in my journey to learn Python.  

I was led to Python through my interest in Data Analytics.  Data is **everywhere** now and I feel like in order to be prepared for future careers, everyone will need to know somce Data Science.
#My Repo
This repo is a place to share my progress.  Not everything will be great, but it's really about showing my growth.  

I view this as a sort of time capsule.  Sometimes it'd difficult to see to the changes we make as we learn new skills, but by keeping a record of my work I'll easily be able to look back and see how far I've gone.
